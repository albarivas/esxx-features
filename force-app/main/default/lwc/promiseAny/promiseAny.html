      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any"
      target="_blank">Promise.any()</a> takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfills, 
      returns a single promise that resolves with the value from that promise. If all of the given promises are rejected, 
      then the returned promise is rejected with
      an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError"
      target="_blank">AggregateError</a>.
      Open <strong>promiseAny.js</strong> on the developer tools to check how it works.
