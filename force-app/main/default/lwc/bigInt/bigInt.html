          target="_blank">BigInt</a> is a built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger
          than 2^53 - 1, which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive.
          Open <strong>bigInt.js</strong> on the developer tools to check how it works.
