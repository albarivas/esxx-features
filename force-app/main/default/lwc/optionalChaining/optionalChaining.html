    <p>
    The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining"
      target="_blank">optional chaining operator (?.)</a> permits reading the value of a property located deep
      within a chain of connected objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.
      If a reference is nullish (null or undefined), the expression short-circuits with a return value of undefined.
      Open <strong>optionalChaining.js</strong> on the developer tools to check how it works.
