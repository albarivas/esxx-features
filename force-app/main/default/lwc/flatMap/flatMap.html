    <p>
        The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flatMap"
          target="_blank">flatMap()</a> method returns a new array formed by applying a given callback function to each 
          element of the array, and then flattening the result by one level. It is identical to a map() followed by a flat() 
          of depth 1, but slightly more efficient than calling those two methods separately.
          Open <strong>flatMap.js</strong> on the developer tools to check how it works.
