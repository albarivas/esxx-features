    <p>
    The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/finally"
      target="_blank">finally()</a> method returns a Promise. When the promise is settled, i.e either fulfilled or rejected, 
      the specified callback function is executed. This provides a way for code to be run whether the promise was 
      fulfilled successfully or rejected once the Promise has been dealt with.
      Open <strong>promiseFinally.js</strong> on the developer tools to check how it works.
