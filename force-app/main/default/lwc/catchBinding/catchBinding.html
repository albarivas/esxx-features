        The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch"
          target="_blank">try...catch</a> statement marks a block of statements to try and specifies a response 
          should an exception be thrown. What's introduced in ES10 is the ability to omit the catch error parameter.
          Open <strong>catchBinding.js</strong> on the developer tools to check how it works.
